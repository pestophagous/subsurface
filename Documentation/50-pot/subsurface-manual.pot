"The _Subsurface_ dive planner allows a sophisticated way of planning "

"The dive planner automatically takes into account the nitrogen load incurred "
"in previous dives. But conventional dive tables are also used in a way that "
"can take into account previous dives. Why use a dive planner for "
"recreational dives? Using recreational dive tables, the maximum depth of a "
"dive is taken into acount. However, few dives are undertaken at a constant "
"depth corresponding to the maximum depth (i.e. a \"square\" dive "
"profile). This means that dive tables overestimate the nitrogen load "

"nitrogen load according to the real dive profiles of all uploaded previous "
"dives, in a similar way as dive computers calculate nitrogen load during a "

"So be happy: your SAC really is better than your calculations indicated.  Or "
"be sad: your cylinder contains less air than you thought it did.  And as "
"mentioned, the \"contains less air than you thought it did\" really starts "
"becoming much more noticeable at high pressure. A 400 bar really does not "
"contain twice as much air as a 200 bar one. At lower pressures, air acts "
"pretty much like an ideal gas."

"'Answer': For example, if you end up doing a weight check (deep enough to "
"trigger the \"dive started\")  but then come back up and wait five minutes "
"for your buddies, your dive computer may say that your dive is 50 minutes "
"long - because you have fifty minutes worth of samples - but subsurface will "
"say it's 45 minutes - because you were actually diving for 45 minutes.  It's "
"even more noticeable if you do things like divemastering the initial OW "
"dives, when you may stay in the water for a long time, but spend most of it "
"at the surface. And then you don't want that to count as some kind of long "
"dive‚Äù."

"'Answer': Dive history is different than the dive profiles on the log.  The "
"history only keeps track of the total number of dives and total amount of "
"time spent below surface. The logs, on the other hand, store the dive "
"profile, but they have limited amount of memory to do so. The exact amount "
"of dive profiles that can be stored on the device depend on sample interval "
"and duration of the dives. Once the memory is full the oldest dives get "
"overwritten with new dives. Thus we are only able to download the last 13, "
"30 or 199 dives."
